  "text": " Good afternoon. I'm here with Matt Douglas, Head of Private Credit at PGM. Matt, thank you for joining us today. If we could start with you just briefly introducing yourself and the company. Sure. Thanks for having me, Max. Appreciate being here. So PGM, the asset manager of Prudential, the insurance company in the United States, $1.4 trillion asset platform. Drilled down, about $1.1 trillion of that is credit, public and private credit, $300 billion of private credit assets within that $1.1 trillion. Corporates, infrastructure, ABF, direct lending, mezzanine, up and down the risk spectrum. So that's our credit platform within the PGM ecosystem. Great. And you've been in the private credit game for 30 years now. What's the single biggest change you've seen in that time? Yeah, so, well, I would say over the last 10 to 15 years, it's clearly the, especially being part of an insurance company, it's this combination of private asset management and insurance coming together. And you're seeing it, and it's driven by a lot of the large private equity players in the industry that were kind of private equity focused, got into credit as part of also being part of an insurance company, maybe acquiring insurance companies, merging with insurance companies, because they're heavy consumers of credit. So you've seen that convergence between those entities over the last 10 plus years, which has really transformed both the asset management and the insurance businesses, creating almost a virtuous cycle between the two entities. And it's kind of interesting from where we sit because we've been having both these elements, insurance and asset management, within one entity for 75 plus years. And so we're already kind of there. And so it's kind of, in a way, the market's kind of come towards us, which has kind of been nice to see. And so we working through how you compete in the market with that combined entity And more recently maybe the biggest change in the last five years Sure well the last five years So what this has also driven, in part, is this kind of convergence of public and private credit, just as I described our credit platform. It's kind of the 1.1 trillion with the 300 billion of private assets in there, credit assets. And it's really happening for a couple of reasons. First, investors. The world used to be, from an allocator standpoint, they had private credit, they had public credit, almost a binary view of those asset classes, driven mostly by illiquidity and complexity was what kind of were the more private credit assets and more just kind of straightforward, more standard issuances in the public market with liquidity. Investors are thinking about that totally differently now. They just view it as credit. And so they think of the world as public and private credit. That's why we have evolved our platform to interface with investors that way. And I would say now you have more of a spectrum. You have a spectrum of, say, illiquidity from way over here, kind of where the traditional private credit was, very illiquid, middle market, perhaps more complex transactions to the very liquid. And where on that spectrum you might be as an investor, partial illiquidity, more complex to more liquid. So it's more about dialing up and down that spectrum now than it has in the past. investor side and on the issuer side, large issuers that used to just do public market issuances to raise capital to solve their problems are now seeing because investors are now thinking more broadly across the spectrum, wait, we can do more structured transactions and so forth, call it private credit, even though it's a large issuer, to solve unique problems they might have with a financing solution that you really would have a hard time getting done in the public market. Right. So are you seeing more hybrid strategies that combine both? Well, certainly on the investor side, for sure, putting together portfolios of multiple different sleeves of private credit. Investors might come to you now with a more complex problem like look I don want to have 10 managers to manage different pockets along there give me one strategy there might be four different types of private assets or a couple private assets classes and a couple public asset classes for example and have investors put that or have asset managers manage all that on a scaled basis with you know the economy to scale that pass through in terms of cost and so forth to the investors so absolutely I mean, that's kind of the name of the game and has been for about five years because of this convergence. Issuers, as I alluded to earlier, they are thinking, you know, they can walk down paths of, as they're looking to finance themselves, a private solution, a public solution. I think a perfect example of that is in the direct lending space for especially large issuers owned by private equity funds. The world used to be that, you know, you go to the high yield market or the BSL market. And then with that transformation of the last 15 years I discussed with, you know, private equity-backed players driving it, there became a private credit option for those issuers that might have two or three lenders involved, more structured, et cetera, versus those options before. Now those issuers have all three. Those issuers and their end pricing's kind of converged. And, you know, now issuers can tap the high-yield market, the BSL market, or a private credit solution, depending on if markets get choppier, that makes access to the high-yield market and the BSL market more challenging. So you might do a private credit solution, for example. So issuers are now walking down the path with more options, I think, on how they're going to finance themselves. Interesting. And with new players now entering the game more and more, how do you maintain differentiation with your peers? Well, I think it always depends is always the answer, right? Depending on what market. So, look, my heritage is kind of the real liquid, middle market, more complex space. And so, for me, it all starts with you have to do three things well to win in private credit. You have to originate a big enough funnel because you can just go buy what you want In the public market you can just hey if I can get access if I like the price I can buy something in most cases So it all starts with you got to have a big funnel a big diverse funnel, and a funnel that wants to interact with you and give you access. Because you got to be given access by the issuer. So I think winning in private credit for investors starts with how do you originate, how do you get access to private credit. We've done it for decades through a regional office across the world, 15 offices, 200 plus investment professionals in the market finding access to private credit for our folks, our investors. Then you got to underwrite it well and that's kind of table stakes. You have to be a good credit shop so you got to make sure you do that. And then on the back end, you have to be able to manage because if you try to trade out of it and you expect to have liquidity when you have a troubled situation, you won't fare very well. So you need to be able to manage when the cycle hits, how to get out of tough situations and have good workout capabilities, etc. So you have to do those three things well over time through credit cycles for your investors. But it starts with how do you originate? Now, I think as more convergence of public and private happens, so again, take maybe like larger issuers like I referred to earlier, that having the ability, which we have this ability, to be in both the public and private markets and really see the relative value live day to day between, let's say, the BSL market and the private credit market for a direct lending situation. And knowing how to pick those credits, having familiarity with them and good deep research to help you make those decisions. I think there's another play there as issuers toggle back the ones that can toggle back between private public options. So it depends, but I think you win different ways in different segments of the market. Thank you for explaining that and thank you for your time. Max, thank you.",
