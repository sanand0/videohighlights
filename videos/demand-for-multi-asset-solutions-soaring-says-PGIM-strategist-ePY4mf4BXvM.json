  "text": " Phil, it's been a growing trend. So please tell me why asset managers are building out their multi-asset solutions? Well, it starts with the clients. The clients are looking to get more capabilities from fewer managers. Second, it's about the markets. breadth of private capabilities are such that there's a blurring between private and public, particularly in private and public credit. And third, it's about how to put it together in a way that works, meaning the pebble in the shoe of the asset owner, you need to find a customized solution that cuts through that complexity and delivers the result. And which client segments are asking PGM multi-asset solutions the most for these types of solutions? Well, what we find at PGM is its insurers and reinsurers, its pensions and high net worth. So insurers and reinsurers are increasingly using public and private credit capabilities to drive solutions for them They need to navigate this complex environment Pensions similarly are trying to do more with fewer managers And this is a new arena for high net worth in terms of how to have semi-liquid structures of public and private assets. Can you dig a little bit deeper and explain to me what these pension fund managers are getting for their money? Exactly what's in those portfolios? So what you have in these portfolios is a mixture of public and private capabilities. Once again, if you look at the proliferation of private credit offerings, at the same time, pension sponsors are very diverse in terms of who they are and their needs, but their staffs aren't increasing. They need to deal with this complexity, find the opportunity, and navigate liquidity and other concerns. Can you also expand on liquidity? because that's a worry. Everyone's going to private market assets, private credit. But at some point people don need to get to the door and you don want them all going towards the door at the same time Well let use insurers as an example for your answer on liquidity Getting liquidity right is the art of this So insurers need to be capital efficient. They need to have their assets and liabilities fit, asset liability management, and they need to make sure their cash flows are in sync with the liability cash flows. And getting that right is how to make this work. And lots of managers want to get into this space. So what does PGM do differently from other folks who are wrapping up and packaging public and private credit? Well, I think you need three things. First, you need scale. You need really diverse capabilities. Just look at the breadth of private credit offerings from middle market direct lending, large cap direct lending, private commercial mortgage loans, private placements, private asset-backed finance, a huge arena there. Then you add all the areas of public credit, investment grade, structured products, et cetera. There is a wide, wide menu that you need to be able to cover that landscape to construct portfolios well Second you need depth in each of these arenas to be able to originate the assets to be able to underwrite to be able to structure work out That going to require teams and technology and capabilities that are quite complex. And then finally, you need to understand the liabilities. And what PGM is strong at is the scale across all those capabilities, the depth, but then also understanding insurers and pensions in particular, their liquidity needs. And then finally, to use the baseball analogy, what ending are we in when it comes to these multi-asset solutions, and especially private market and private credit investing? I think we're still relatively early. You know, private credit's going to grow. That's a trend. It's driven by regulatory drivers as well as borrowers' appetites. So you think about it, borrowers can choose between public and private markets to finance their companies. Investors need to move across that line that's blurring. And there'll be much more that happens in terms of high net worth, more with insurers and pensions. All right. Well, thanks for coming on and talking about it. Excellent, Craig. Thanks very much.",
