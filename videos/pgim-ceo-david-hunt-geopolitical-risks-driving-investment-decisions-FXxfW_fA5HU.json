  "text": " Geopolitical risk remains high and economies around the world face different paths ahead. Take us through what this means for investors. Welcome back now, David Hunt. He's president and CEO of PGM. Great to have you back. It's wonderful to be back with you, David. So let's start with the geopolitics because we have a heightened level of geopolitical risk these days all around the world, pretty much wherever we look. How does that affect investors? Well, the first thing I would say, David, is that it may be heightened relative to the last 10 or 12 years. But I would not say it's necessarily heightened relative to the longer term sweep of history. We've actually had a period of real, I would say, moderation since the GFC in terms of political flashpoints. And it's really been the last few years between the health pandemic, two wars, that we've started to see these reemerge. And I would say it's more of a getting back to normal than it is actually a heightening of the averages. I would also say that I think that this kind of summer of democracy, which we're still working our way through, is only heightening that as well. So I think we have even more geopolitical risk. And indeed, as I travel the world talking to our large institutional investors, their number one risk is geopolitical. It is not what's the Fed going to do. It's not where are we in the interest rate cycle. they really want to talk about the heightened geopolitical risk and what that does for their portfolio construction. So talk to me about that very issue, the intersection, if you will, between economic growth and the path forward to long term, because you're a long term investor. Right, right. How that intersects with the politics and the geopolitics. I mean, how does the politics potentially affect the long term growth of a Europe, of a Japan, of the United States? Well, it's really interesting because long term investors have a very different attitude toward, I think, volatility in general. And that's probably the biggest difference. So I think a lot of the popular media confuse volatility and risk. And they're really not the same thing. So when I say we have heightened volatility, that actually can spell as much opportunity as it does risk I mean the only way you lose money is to sell an asset for less than you bought it for or take a permanent impairment But simply because markets move does not create a loss and long-term investors tend to look through those cycles, and they use changes in market levels to actually get in at a more attractive price. So as we look forward to the increased volatility. Our key focus is do our clients have enough liquidity so that they can move and move in size when the time is right. And I would say that as people have moved more into privates and more into illiquid assets, that liquidity has become a bit squeezed. And a lot of the work we're doing with clients is to make sure that they have the liquidity so that they can move when the timing is right. It's one of the things your institutional investors take a look at, your institutional clients is long-term growth prospects. Because right now, it looks like, for example, Europe is different from the United States. Just to take one example. No, it's a great example. And I would say that we are seeing a pretty big rotation in how people view growth opportunities and where they're putting capital over. So if you start in Europe, in general, people are quite, I think, pessimistic about growth. The EU is no bigger now than it was in 2018. And it really doesn't seem to be breaking out of the cycle of low productivity and low growth that it's had. Meanwhile, you then go to Asia and you find, on the one hand, Japan, which is, I would say, in a new kind of found optimism. They finally have inflation back, which they're grateful for. Growth has come back. They're very constructive about some of the reforms that they've made to corporate governance. And I would say there's more optimism there and about international investors looking in than we've had in a long time. And in fact, I would say that Japan has been the leading country to benefit from the tensions with China because many people are now building their plants and building their supply lanes around a strategy that's based in Japan. So Japan, I think, is much more positive. China on the other hand is probably in a more difficult position Even last week with the third plenum we did not see the kind of concerted action that we all thought was going to be needed So I think people are worried about growth and they're worried that there isn't going to be a resurgence of consumer spending, which is what really needs to rebalance the economy, but rather continued focus on manufacturing. So there's no new money at the moment going into China. Then you come back to the U.S. And as difficult, and we like to focus on all the problems of the U.S., actually productivity has looked not bad. Growth is looking like it's powering through this difficulty. Wages continue to be pretty strong. So the U.S. is on a relative basis at this point doing very well. So the net of that is that there There is really money coming out of Europe. There is no more money going into China. There's quite a bit more money going into the US and Japan. And then select emerging markets like I would say Mexico, Vietnam, Indonesia, which are benefiting from the changes in the global supply chain. So it's a very differencing shift in how people are putting their money to work geographically. Let's pick up on one thing that you just referred to, which I find puzzling. here in the United States, maybe in part because of the election, not entirely, we tend to be very critical of what's going on economically. We're in a lot of trouble, a lot of uncertainty and things. And yet the rest of the world seems to want to invest here. The inflows are remarkable here. By the way, a lot of people want to come here. That's one of the reasons we have an immigration problem is everybody wants to move here. Who's got it wrong? I mean, are we misperceiving our own economy or is the rest of the world overestimating what we can do? I think it's maybe maybe a little bit of both and maybe a third as well. I think that there's no question that the corporate sector and therefore what's driving earnings and therefore kind of the markets is in better health than almost any of us would have predicted 18 months ago. That doesn't necessarily mean that consumer sentiment or the average person is feeling that way. And for them, they're much more likely to feel actually the world's 20% more expensive than it was three years and my wages haven gone up by 20 So for the median worker you don feel that things are quite so great here So both of those stories I think are equally true But what we do have, I think, is a very dynamic economy. And if the pandemic told us anything, it was, you know, we were chaotic. Every state did it differently. We couldn't enforce rules. All of the things that we don't like about ourselves. And yet, and yet we came out of it, I think, pretty strongly, pretty quickly. And our corporate sector was able to actually rebalance, with a lot of help from the government, obviously, very quickly. And I'd say that our rebound is a real sign of strength of the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. Historically, the downside, if there is one, to some of the alternative investments, is you give some liquidity. You know, you freeze it up. So in this world, where you're getting real yield out of bonds, why are people willing to give some liquidity, actually in alternatives. For example, is PGM backing off alternatives right now? So no, we actually, you know, we have about $300 billion in alternatives assets under management. So it's about a quarter of our total assets and probably one of the fastest growing areas of the market. And for us, it's mostly about private credit and also about real estate rather than private equity. And those we actually think are going to be very good growth engines going forward. Private credit is undergoing, I think, a real sea change. You know, since the GFC, banks have continued to back out of lending money into the middle market. And so private investors and asset managers like PGM have really stepped into that void. I don't see that reversing. I think that this asset class is going to continue to grow, and it's going to go from direct lending, which has been into the middle market, to now asset-based finance. So these were all on bank bank's balance sheets. It's project finance, infrastructure, rail car leasing, aircrafts, and all of these which historically were not done through the private credit ecosystem. Now they are. So that is really, I think, a fundamental shift in the way the economy is being funded and it creates real opportunities for asset managers like PGM. David, it's such a treat always to have you on. Thank you so much. That is David Hunt of PGM.",
