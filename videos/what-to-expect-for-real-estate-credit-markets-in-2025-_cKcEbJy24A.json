  "text": " So you do real estate credit. If we look at a 5% 10-year, how do you feel the next morning? That's where I get uncomfortable. Okay. Right. Where we started saying in the real estate market, we think it's pricing in the fours. And we had said about a little bit, 18 months ago, you saw it flirt with five. I don't think it actually closed, but I think it hit $4.99. And you started seeing some stress because that's where we get into a different world. Where is your world now versus like a year ago? And what do you like? If we stay in the fours, what does your world look like this year? I think the world looks like this year. say in the fours, a very busy 2025. We haven't been in a credit cycle. We've been in a confidence cycle for this this last go around. And it's been much more about borrowers being willing to tolerate the rate than whether they could transact or not. And so as we see that the race to a 3 percent treasury doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon. You're seeing more of a realization that a 4 percent 10 year treasury. Keep in mind we started 2024 a year ago at 4 percent. And people thought that was too high. I think people would take that deal right now. And so I think as if it stays in there, we're seeing people just saying, you know, I got to move. And there's a big refinance year coming off of 2015. When you're looking for investment opportunities, though, given that rate backdrop that you just talked about, talked about, I mean, what is most attractive now? Like sort of what is going to be more resilient? Maybe that's a better way of putting it. We always think real estate is long term asset class. And so we're playing into where we think demographic trends. So we have long over weighted global living. IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED. IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED. INDUSTRIAL, THE OFFSHOES THERE IS SELF-STORAGE AND DATA CENTERS AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT BEEN OVERWEIGHT RETAIL IS HAVING ITS HAYDAY COVID IN A WAY IN TERMS OF FIXING THE LAST OF THE PROBLEMS THERE A LOT OF PLACES problems So there a lot of places I mean I would say everywhere but office We seeing opportunity It interesting too We having this conversation with you who runs PGM real estate and not say a traditional banker at one of the big money center banks And this is kind of the evolution of this investment environment for real estate I mean you guys are the dominant players now in the private space And I am curious if that aids or distorts the price activity and price discovery in the real estate market I think it aids And I think the diversity of lending is one of the strengths of the U.S. market. I've been in this market for 25 years so now I'm finally in the center and people want to talk to me. But eventually you wait long enough you come to the center. But what I mean by that is as you have a market that's more diverse and have different sorts of lenders that's good. You know we need the banks. We need CNBS. Private credit has its really important move. And we see actually if you go globally that playing out more in Europe and Asia which are much more bank centered and the markets have less flexibility and less creativity because of that. Here's my question though. If we get less capital requirements and a less stringent stress test from the Fed, do you think the banks come back more in full and compete with what you guys are doing? Absolutely. Absolutely. But we've been here for 25 years. So this isn't I think some of the narrative that the private credit is covering the bank gap is a little bit of a misstatement that we've been here for a long time. We're going to continue to be here. We partner with banks. They lend to us. We may go behind them in deals. And it's an ECO SYSTEM I THINK ABOUT MUCH MORE. AND SO WE'RE BIG PARTNERS WITH THE BANKS AND WE'LL ALL FIND OUR SPACE. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. MAYBE IT'S NOT SUBSTITUTION. SO YOU MENTIONED A TON OF DIFFERENT ASSETS THAT ARE INTERESTING IN REAL ESTATE. WHERE IS THE ONE YOU'RE PLAYING IN THE MOST RIGHT NOW OR THAT YOU'RE MOST EXCITED ABOUT FOR THIS YEAR? STILL LIVING. STILL RESIDENTIAL WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL UNDERSUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN go anywhere without seeing that in the market We trying to play into that trying to figure out how do we add housing to the markets and how do we play to add capital How do we do that I don want to get too deep into politics but we do have a president coming in to office in about a week and a half time He kind of made it clear at least some of his policy proposals on the campaign trail seem like they were going to try to address some of the housing issues housing supply issues in this country Is that a bankable idea right now or an investable idea or do you just kind of have to wait to see the whites of the eyes of that program? I think we have to see how that plays out. But I do think going back to real estate is a long-term asset class. We don't pivot to an administration. We go much more in the long term. We've been doing this for 140 years for us. I haven't been that long. 25 years for me. We have to play in the long game. And I think the clear demographic trends are we need more housing. We need more logistics. We're trying to play into that. When you see the folks who are investing in this space, allocating more to their portfolio in this space, are we primarily talking about domestic investors or are you seeing more interest from folks outside our country looking to invest in our real estate? Certainly we're seeing global investors come into the U.S. The U.S. market is an outperformer. It's got its challenges, but it's still doing really quite well. So we're seeing lots of interest in the U.S. economic story right now. And that is, you know, from around the world. So for residential, here's my confusion. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROPOSITION. IF YOU BUILD A SUPER HIGH-END FANCY THING WHERE YOU HAVE A GYM AND A POOL AND THE WHOLE SHEBANG, THAT'S GOING TO BE EASY FOR A BORROWER. IT'S GOING TO BE EASY FOR YOU GUYS TO COME TOGETHER. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE A CHARGE THAT MUCH, THAT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY TOUGH PROPOSITION. HOW IS IT COMING TO A DEAL LIKE THAT? THAT WHERE THE AGENCIES COME IN WE ONE OF THE LARGER AGENCY LENTERS FOR FANNY AND focused on mission naturally affordable housing and they playing into that in a big way And so there capital up and down the capital stack to be able to play into that Fannie and Freddie. I remember we used to talk about that. Are they actually going to come out completely? It doesn't matter to you? It doesn't matter to us. If you spend time trying to figure out how each player, back to the bank question, it's an ecosystem. Everyone will kind of have their space and will kind of continue to evolve. But there's capital that's needed for housing. In terms of residential, where do you think we're going to see the biggest movement this year? Regional, type on residential, what do you think? You know, in some ways, some of the CBD markets are coming back. You know, there was such a move to the Sun Belt. Everyone's played there. There's probably a little bit of adjustment in the Sun Belt as some of the temporary oversupply that'll play out over the next, you know, few years. I'm not worried. THAT WILL PLAY OUT. SOME OF THE CEDE MARKETS HAVE SOME GOOD DEMOGRAPHIC. IF WE DO START TO SEE A MATERIAL INCREASE IN BUILDING, MEANING BUILDING NEW HOUSING, DO YOU THINK MOST OF THAT IS GOING TO BE MULTIFAMILY OR ARE WE GOING TO STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES NOW WHICH IS PRIMARILY FOCUS ON SINGLE FAMILY. I'M FOCUSED ON MULTIFAMILY. WE FOCUS ON MULTIFAMILY. there is that the reason it's an interesting asset class is the last cycle was an appreciation and leverage game. As rates went down, you were able to appreciate and leverage your way. This next cycle, we're already in it, is all about income. And the stable income that provides, which is a credit shines, that's a good opportunity for credit, but also plays for certain asset classes that we like in industrial and residential because those tend to be income plays. They're not necessarily an appreciation play.",
